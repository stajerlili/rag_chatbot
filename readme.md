# RAG based chatbot with LangGraph

## Setup 

1. I created a conda environment (I suppose it should work with regular venv as well, but I prefer conda to set the python version):
```shell
conda create -p ./rag_env python=3.10
```

2. Activated the env

3. Installed dependencies by running
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. You can run the program by:
```
python rag_advanced.py
```

## Documentation

I didn't use a jupyter notebook for development, I hope that is not a problem, I am just more comfortable with regular py files. 
Also at first I accidentally completely disregarded that the framework to be used is LangGraph, therefore I have a simpler solution in the form of rag.py.
